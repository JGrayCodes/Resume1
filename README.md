# resume-challenges
This repo contains the Resumé Challenges of CodeSpace's Intro to Web course 

There are separate html documents for each resumé version

At the moment there are 3 versions of the resumé as follows:

* resume1.html - contains only text content
* resume2.html - is resume1.html but with images and links (both internal and extenal)
* resume3.html - is resume2.html updated to include semantic elements (header, footer, section, aside, and article semantic elements)
* resume4.html - is resume3.html updated to include A bit of css styling (changes in font family and font colour, background colours, and reusable css classes)
