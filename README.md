# resume-challenges
This repo contains the Resumé Challenges of CodeSpace's Intro to Web course 

There are separate html documents for each resumé version

At the moment there are 4 versions of the resumé as follows:

* __resume1.html__ - <br/> contains only text content
* __resume2.html__ - <br/> is resume1.html but with images and links (both internal and external)
* __resume3.html__ - <br/> is resume2.html updated to include semantic elements (header, footer, section, aside, and article semantic elements)
* __resume4.html__ - <br/> is resume3.html updated to include A bit of css styling (changes in font family and font colour, background colours, and reusable css classes)
